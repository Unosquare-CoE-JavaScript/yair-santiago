# Report / Notes YDKJY

## Chapter 1

This chapter talks about how Javascript is a language that most people wrongly take just as interpreted, when in fact, it has a previous lexical parsing before execution.

This lexical parsing can throw errors before executing _any_ function, which "contradicts" the interpreted principle. Now, Javascript can't either be considered a compiled language, as source instructions are necessary and bytecode/optimization depends on the engine.

There is a way to workaround this optimization, like when using `eval()` to assign a variable or create a function before calling or printing them.

```javascript
function laterAssign() {
    eval("var testVar = '1234';");
    console.log('The value of testVar is', testVar);
}
```

## Chapter 2

This chapter goes deeper in the scope, comparing how there could be marbles and buckets, classifying every marble within their corresponding bucket as it could be about the scope with variables and functions.

There is also a mention that, scopes are up to the closest variable (or function, class, etc) it finds, if it isn't found in such context it will go to the next context and continue like that until it finds itself in the global scope. In the case no declaration is found, then it can go two ways:

  * If strict mode is disabled, it will create the variable on the global scope (window)
  * If strict mode is enabled, it could just throw an error.

## Chapter 3

This is kind of a join between chapter 1 and chapter 2, it starts out clarifying the "scope lookup" as described in those chapters, is more of a concept than the actual working way, where JS engines might or might not create a scope in the lexical parsing phase, as sometimes other imported files or environments might declare/assign them without the analyzer knowing it first.

Next part is the "shadowing" of lexical names, about how this

```javascript
var sameName = "Foo";

function printVar(sameName) {
  sameName = sameName.toUpperCase();
  console.log(sameName);
}
```

  * Will print
    * `"BAR"` when called with `printVar("bar")`  
    * `"FOO"` when called with `printVar(sameName)`
    * `"Foo"` when printing the var from outside

And how this is actually an intended behavior in JS due to the scoping, while not recommended. There's also a mention about how this can be avoided by using the `window` object to access the global scope, but neither recommending to, as code gets confusing.

### NAMED VS ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS

This section talks about the different ways to create a function, whose simplest declaration is in the form of `function doSomething() {...}` (this is a named function). This is _not_ the only way to create functions in Javascript, and pretty much every of them have different uses.

Methods to create functions include

**ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS**
```javascript
var doSomething = function() {

}
```

```javascript
var doSomething = () => {

}
```

and a initually-confusing one (which is also named)

```javascript
var doSomething = function somethingElse() {

}
```
This last one might seem like it creates the `somethingElse()` function on the global scope, but it is not the case as it gets into an "implied scope" in `doSomething`.

There is, for example, no difference between arrow functions and the standard definition (`function`) functions in terms of scope.

## Chapter 4

The chapter talks about how there's often a misconception on that the global context should _not_ be used, and that it is a bad practise, but explains there are cases even in complex systems such as bundlers, they do use them in order to modules working as expected.

Next, there is the aclaration, that for browser API's, DOM objects and other helpers, the global context _is_ unavoidable.

### ENVIRONMENT DIFFERENCES

The book states that, depending on where is JS being run, there might be some differences on wheter it is run standalone (as in Node) or in a web browser, the later will provide a "pure", yet somehow confusing environment, with the following oddities:

  * It has the `window` object available..
  * Browser globals _can_ be "shadowed" too.
  * True global variables need to use `var` to avoid being oddly excluded.
  * The variable `window.name` behaves strangely even when being shadowed.
  * Every element with an `id` property can have a global created for it (yet it is not recommended to use them).

In the case JS is run inside a _Web Worker_, there is no window object and global context is only available inside `self`.

In the case of Node, there is an especific object literally called `global`, that while it doens't expose any browser related API's (some of them have been reimplemented, though), it exposes globally to all modules as expected.

## Chapter 5

This part starts making a common example for many JS developers, that just as it says, usually nobody questions why, and the reason would be called "hoisting".

Hoisting is a feature/benefit from the lexical parser phase of the script running, which does "move" function and variable declarations to the top, so they can be used anywhere within the scope. It can be considered usually a "rewrite" of the original script.

Hoisting, however, does take very special (and somehow surprising) behaviors in many cases, like in the following example:

```javascript
var preAssignedVar = "Hey";
console.log(preAssignedVar); // will print "Hey"

var preAssignedVar;
```
The logic might say that if we call `console.log(preAssignedVar)` at the end, the value might be `undefined`, but that is not the case. The value `"Hey"` will be kept, because such assignation has no subsecuent call and `preAssignedVar` was already initiallized, making the following declaration a no-op.

Shall there be another redeclaration (with assignation) to such variable, like
```javascript
var preAssignedVar = undefined;
```
then the value would change for the following lines when called. This reassignation can _only_ be done with `var`, not `let` and even more impossibly with `const`.

A following section explains there is only a declaration when using `var` inside loops, but the reasignation is what makes the value change, like in their example:

```javascript
var keepGoing = true; 
while (keepGoing) {
  var value = Math.random(); 
  if (value > 0.5) {
    keepGoing = false;
  }
}
```
`value`Â is not redeclared, because of how `var` and hoisting works.

The same will keep true using `let` or `const` in `for` cycles, but make an exception with `const` when doing incremental cicles, because the increment will try to change the constant value.

Last part goes with a warning, which says that `let` and `const`do also hoist, but without being initialized with a value like with , so they're there, just not available to do something with their values. An advice from the author is that these variables should be put at the start of the scope, as a "standard" code would.

## Chapter 6

Now, this book as been talking about how the scopes can mix up things and some advantages/disadvantages of it, but this chapter in particular, now its more about how to limit the exposure or privilege of the variables, as it is considered a _good practise_. The concept reviewed here in particular is POLP (_Principle of Lease Privilege_).

POLP treats variables as something that might get collisions, unexpected behavior/results or non-wanted dependency. All of this relies precisely on how scopes work, like the first paragraph asks: why can't just every variable be on the global scope? The reason is something we've naturally come to avoid as our minds get to understand the code and can be stressed into just one word: problems.

A common way to protect the scope of variables is wrapping their declarations only within functions that return their actual function after wrapping the "global" variables it uses. An example of this is:

```javascript
function wrappedFnWithGlobals() {
  var wrappedResults = {};
  
  function doCalc(n) {
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    if (!wrappedResuls[n]) {
      wrappedResults[n] = n * Math.PI;
    }
    return wrappedResults[n];
  }
  
  return doCalc;
}
```

## Chapter 7

Closure is, in short, the ability or advantage to access objects or variables outside their scope within functions. This is exemplified in the book with:

```javascript
function lookupStudent(studentID) {
  var students = [
      { id: 14, name: "Kyle" },
      { id: 73, name: "Suzy" },
      { id: 112, name: "Frank" },
      { id: 6, name: "Sarah" }
  ];
  return function greetStudent(greeting) {
      var student = students.find(
          student => student.id == studentID
      );
      return `${greeting}, ${student.name}!`;
  };
}
var chosenStudents = [
  lookupStudent(6),
  lookupStudent(112)
];
```

In this part, the peculiarity to this code is the fact that the `studentId` is kept along with the `students` even when a function declaration is returned. The common conception is that the students variable would be deleted by the garbage collector once executed, but instead, it is kept because of the reference inside the closure.

Closure also follows POLP, as the needed variables are _not_ getting modified unintentionally after of the moment they're set up from outside (which may be intended or not). Subsequent calls also keep using the enclosed values so, for example, a counter will only increase or decrease only by the calls inside.

Setting up event listeners is also something that can benefit from closures, as references are used/kept within the setup function.

## Chapter 8

Just like the introduction of this chapter begins with, the Modules are the mix of all that has been thaught here: closures and scopes.

Modules should respect visibility to be called like that: private members (which access should _not_ be exposed outside) and public members (which _can_ and should be exposed outside).

Modules have 3 ways to be declared in Javascript:

* **Clasic Modules**
  It can be done using IIFE or Instance-like definitions.
  Example:
  
  ```javascript
  // Single instance
  var Manager = (function createManager() {
    var rows = [
      {id: 1, name: "Luis", age: 22},
      {id: 2, name: "Pedro", age: 18},
      {id: 3, name: "Alondra", age: 31},
    ];
    
    var publicMembers = { getFromId }
    return publicMembers;
    
    function getFromId(userId) {
      return rows.find(row => row.id === userId) ?? null;
    }
  })();
  ```
  
  
  
* **CommonJS Modules**
  (Only available for Node) These modules are defined within their own file, and can use "global" variables or functions inside those files, which won't be output to the global scope unless they're exported using `module.exports`.
  Later they can be imported inside an object by using

  ```javascript
  var Manager = require('path/to/managerModule.js');
  ```

  or deconstructed like this in case the exports are object-like
  
  ```javascript
  var { namedImport } = require('path/to/multipleExported.js')
  ```
  
* **ES Modules (ESM)**
  Very similar to CommonJS, but it's available for browser and Node. The main difference is the export command format, the default export, and the forced (implied) "strict mode".

  ```javascript
  // moduleFile.js
  export default function defaultFn() {
    console.log('Hello from default export');
  }
  
  export function logHelloWorld() {
    console.log('Hello world');
  }
  
  // main.js
  import defaultFn, { logHelloWorld } from './moduleFile';
  defaultFn(); // Will log "Hello from default export"
  logHelloWorld(); // Will log "Hello world"
  ```

Modules are a nice way to keep everything organized and properly managed with private and public methods. They're a powerful way to construct modern apps with a structured/modular approach, definitely it's a must for modern JS.

## Appendix A

### **Implied Scopes**

When using simple parameters, the scope of such parameters fall into the function scope without creating another.

Simple parameters for Javascript are only when every parameter of the function does **_not_** meet any of the following conditions:

* Has a default value
  ie: `parameter = "defaultval"`
* Uses rest parameters
  ie: `...config`
* De-structures any parameter
  ie: `{ username, id }`

If the case any of those are meet, then a **_new_** scope is created in the middle of the function and the outer scope. This can be observed in the following example:

```javascript
function extraScopeFn(id, defaultId = id) {
  id = 5;
  console.log('the default value is', defaultId);
}
```

If we were to call `extraScopeFn(3)` the console would print `3`as the `defaultID` would be handled along with the `id` in a new scope _previous_ to the function code.

### **Anonymous vs Named functions**

The book explains anonymous functions are commonly miss-used as functions usually have a _purpose_, and such purpose should be properly stated for the developers, maintainers and/or debuggers to know it. Stack traces will contain such names, which is important to understand where a code is breaking.

A special stress is made into the fact that Javascript _might_ infer the name of a function in cases an anonymous function is assigned to a variable name, like in the following example:

```javascript
var unnamedFnName = function() {/*...*/}
var objectWithFn = { fnName: function() {/*...*/} }
```

`unnamedFnName.name` and `objectWithFn.fnName.name` will print `unnamedFnName` and `fnName` respectively, which isn't bad, yet should be used with caution, as "Any assignment of a function expression thatâs not a simple assignment will fail name inferencing".

Named functions are also essential when using callbacks and/or event listeners, so that they can be cancelled, for example, using `obj.removeEventListener('event', namedFnName)`.

**"A note about Arrow Functions"**

The author goes a little against this kind of functions, as they're anonymous by nature, yet I could be more on my side when saying they do work in outer context, which is mentioned, but omitted as a heavy reason.

### **var isn't done yet**

Some linters and advices out there do usually say `var` should _not_ be used anymore, but the author says otherwise, stating that if it has been around for 25 years, it's for a reason. He suggest that `var`can remain for global scope, as it has all the implications of global, but in other cases, he also suggest it for `function`-scoped variables.

A part of this section also reminds that `const` isn't an exact implementation of full immutability, as object instances **_can_** get modified. Only primitive values are truly constant.

### **Synchronous callbacks?**

This section debates wether synchronous calls can be called callbacks or not, and ends up stating that the term might be incorrect, as they're more of _Dependency Injection_ (DI) or _Inversion of Control_ (IoC).

There's a paragraph that says: "DI can be summarized as passing in necessary part(s) of functionality to another part of the program so that it can invoke them to complete its work.". Which would actually work better.

Similarly, IoC is stated as: "Inversion of control means that instead of the current area of your program controlling whatâs happening, you hand control off to another part of the program."

Yet the author suggest a new term: `IIF`: *Inter-Invoked Functions*. To be functions whose invocation happens from another entity.

### **Universal Module Definitions**

While the book does get into variants of module definitions, the only one that matters for the sake of inter-compatibility is the UMD (*Universal Module Definition*), which takes the next form:

```javascript
(function UMD(name, context, definition) {
  if (
  	typeof define === 'function' && define.amd
  ) {
    define(definition)
  }
  else if (
  	typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports
  ) {
    module.exports = definition(name, context);
  }
  else {
    context[name] = definition(name, context)
  }
})('ModuleName', this, function DEF(name, context) {
  var rows = [];
  
  return {
    namespacedPublicFn() {
      console.log(rows);
    }
  }
});
```

This works with (almost) all popular loaders, including AMD, CommonJS and plain vainilla JS.

## Appendix B - Exercises

### Exercise #1

write a programâany program!â that contains nested functions and block scopes, which satisfies these constraints:

* If you color all the scopes (including the global scope!) different colors, you need at least six colors. Make sure to add a code comment labeling each scope with its color.

* Each scope has at least one identifier.

* Contains at least two function scopes and at least two

  block scopes.

* At least one variable from an outer scope must be

  shadowed by a nested scope variable.

* At least one variable reference must resolve to a variable declaration at least two levels higher in the scope chain.

```javascript
// SCOPE 1: global scope
var userName = 'Luis';

// SCOPE 2: non-standar parameter, implied scope
function findUserInList(userId = null) {
  // SCOPE 3: function-scope
  var foundId = -1;
  
  const userList = [
    {id: 1, name: "Pedro", age: 18},
    {id: 2, name: "Luis", age: 22},
    {id: 3, name: "Alondra", age: 31},
  ];
  
  // SCOPE 4: loop-scoped user, implicit
  for (let user of users) {
    if ( user.id === userId ) {
      // SCOPE 5: block-scoped variables
      let userData = {...user}
      
      (function setUserBack(userData) {
        // SCOPE 6: function-scope
        foundId = userData.id;
        userName = userList[foundId].name;
      })(userData);
    }
  }
}
```

### Exercise #2 - part 1

The first part of this exercise is to use closure to implement a cache to remember the results of isPrime(..), so that the primality (true or false) of a given number is only ever computed once.

```javascript
var cachedPrimeCalculator = function constructModule() {
  let cache = {};
  
	function isPrime(v) {
    if (cache[v]) { return cache[v] }
    if (v <= 3) {
      !cache[v] && (cache[v] = v > 1);
      return cache[v];
    }
    if (v % 2 == 0 || v % 3 == 0) {
      !cache[v] && (cache[v] = false);
      return cache[v];
    }
    var vSqrt = Math.sqrt(v);
    for (let i = 5; i <= vSqrt; i += 6) {
      if (v % i == 0 || v % (i + 2) == 0) {
	      !cache[v] && (cache[v] = false);
        return cache[v];
      }
    }
    !cache[v] && (cache[v] = true);
    return cache[v];
  }
  
  return isPrime;
};

var isPrime = cachedPrimeCalculator();

function factorize(v) {
	if (!isPrime(v)) {
		let i = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(v)); while (v % i != 0) {
			i--;
		}
		return [
      ...factorize(i), 
      ...factorize(v / i)
		];
	}
	return [v];
}
```

### Exercise #2 - part 2

You will pass one or more values (as arguments) into tog- gle(..), and get back a function. That returned function will alternate/rotate between all the passed-in values in order, one at a time, as itâs called repeatedly.

```javascript
function toggle(...states) {
    var lastIndex = -1;

    return function toggleNext() {
      	lastIndex = lastIndex >= states.length-1
					? 0
					: lastIndex + 1
        return states[lastIndex]
    }
}

const hello = toggle("hello", "world");
hello(); // -> "hello"
hello(); // -> "world"
hello(); // -> "hello"
```

### Exercise #2 - part 3

Create a calculator which holds the state and allows multiple operations

```javascript
// function useCalc(/*...*/) {/*...*/}
// function formatDisplay(/*...*/) {/*...*/}
function calculator() {
    var total = 0;
    var lastOperand = "#"; // # -> null state
    var writeCache = "";

    var digit = /\d/;
    var operands = /[*/+-]/;

    function reset() {
        lastOperand = "#";
        writeCache = "";
    }

    return function handleInput(key) {
        if ( digit.test(key) ) {
            writeCache += key;
            return key;
        }

        else if ( operands.test(key) ) {
            if ( lastOperand !== '#' && writeCache ) {
                handleInput("=");
            }
            else if ( writeCache ) {
                total = parseInt(writeCache, 10)
            }
            
            lastOperand = key;
            writeCache = "";
            return key;
        }

        else if ( key === '=' ) {
            total = doMath(lastOperand, total, parseInt(writeCache, 10));
            reset();
            return formatDisplay(total);
        }

        return;
    }
}

function doMath(opType, left, right) {
    switch (opType) {
        case '+':
            return left + right;
        case '-':
            return left - right;
        case '*':
            return left * right;
        case '/':
            return left / right;
    }
}
```

### Exercise #3

Convert the math into a Module

```javascript
(function UMD(name, context, definition) {
  if (
  	typeof define === 'function' && define.amd
  ) {
    define(definition)
  }
  else if (
  	typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports
  ) {
    module.exports = definition(name, context);
  }
  else {
    context[name] = definition(name, context)
  }
})('calculator', this, function DEF(name, context) {
    let total = 0;
    let lastOperand = "#"; // # -> null state
    let writeCache = "";
    
    return {
        number,
        operand,
        plus,
        minus,
        mult,
        div,
        eq
    };
    
    function reset() {
        lastOperand = "#";
        writeCache = "";
    }
    
    function number(n) {
        writeCache += n;
        console.log('writeCache', writeCache)
        return n;
    }
    
    function operand(op) {
        if ( lastOperand !== '#' && writeCache ) {
            eq();
        }
        else if ( writeCache ) {
            total = parseInt(writeCache, 10);
        }
        
        lastOperand = op;
        writeCache = "";
        console.log(`operand(${op}) called, lastOperand`, lastOperand);
        console.log('total is now', total);
        return op;
    }
    
    function plus() { return operand('+') }
    function minus() { return operand('-') }
    function mult() { return operand('*') }
    function div() { return operand('/') }
    function eq() {
        total = doMath(lastOperand, total, parseInt(writeCache, 10));
        console.log('total is now', total);
        reset();
        return formatTotal(total);
    }
});
```

### Thoughts

This book has been a way to challenge what I already knew about JS. As someone who comes from a long story in web development, I've already faced much of what's covered on this book, yet, without proper definitions and guides (there were really few back then) as nowhere close as its been perfectly explained in here. Now with more knowledge I will continue on making better code and watch out for unwanted behaviors in closures and scopes.
